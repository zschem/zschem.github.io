Highly motivated and results-driven Ph.D. Material Chemistry with expertise in polymer chemistry, lipid biochemistry, and nanobiotechnology, specifically focused on developing next-generation polymer-lipid nanodiscs (VEMA, SMALP) for the structural and functional characterization of membrane proteins. Proven track record in complex synthetic methodologies (RAFT, VEMA copolymerization), advanced instrumental analysis (EPR, DLS, NMR, SEC), and a strong publication record, including first-author papers in high-impact journals. Seeking a challenging research position to leverage advanced polymer and biophysical techniques to solve complex problems in materials science or structural biology.

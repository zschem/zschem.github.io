description: "Native lipid bilayer mimetics, including those that use amphiphilic polymers, are important for the effective study of membrane-bound peptides and proteins. Copolymers of vinyl ether monomers and maleic anhydride were developed with controlled molecular weights and hydrophobicity through reversible addition–fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization. After polymerization, the maleic anhydride units can be hydrolyzed, giving dicarboxylates. The vinyl ether and maleic anhydride copolymerized in a close to alternating manner, giving essentially alternating hydrophilic maleic acid units and hydrophobic vinyl ether units along the backbone after hydrolysis. The vinyl ether monomers and maleic acid polymers self-assembled with lipids, giving vinyl ether maleic acid lipid particles (VEMALPs) with tunable sizes controlled by either the vinyl ether hydrophobicity or the polymer molecular weight. These VEMALPs were able to support membrane-bound proteins and peptides, creating a new class of lipid bilayer mimetics."
